# Surveys API

An in-memory data store of surveys, with a REST API. Surveys are ordered lists of questions (see schema below).

## Getting Started

After cloning this repo:

```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
```

## Question Schema

- type (**required**): "date" | "text entry" | "multiple choice"
- prompt (**required**): question text (e.g. "Why?")

- `POST /api/v1/surveys` : create a survey; expects a list of questions
- `GET /api/v1/surveys` : get all surveys
